# Introduction to Automated Testing with Azure DevOps

## Overview

In this lab you are going to explore Azure DevOps with a focus on automated testing. You will learn about the differences of the build and release pipelines and get to know where which type of automated test is appropriate.

The baseline of this lab is a pre-built solution called [Parts Unlimited](https://github.com/Microsoft/PartsUnlimited). Based on this solution, an Azure DevOps Environment has been prepared for you via the [Azure DevOps Demo Generator](https://azuredevopsdemogenerator.azurewebsites.net/).

The Azure DevOps environment contains all the source code, pre-configured build and pre-configured release pipelines.

## Prerequisites

* A modern browser. For example, Edge, Chrome/Chromium or Firefox.
* Visual Studio Code

Depending on your lab environment, a pre-configured Virtual Machine might be available for you.

## Preparation

1. TODO: Describe the prep work to configure the missing pieces after the demo generator and deploy everything once.

## Exercise 1: Build Pipeline and Unit Tests

1. TODO: Describe the unit test stuff.

## Exercise 2: Release Pipeline and UI Tests
